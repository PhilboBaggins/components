Manufacturer description
------------------------

we've had a lot of people looking for a dedicated and well-designed data logging shield. We worked hard to engineer an inexpensive but well-rounded design. Not only is it easy to assemble and customize, it also comes with great documentation and libraries.

You can get going quickly - saving data to files on any FAT16 or FAT32 formatted SD card, to be read by any plotting, spreadsheet or analysis program. We even have a tutorial on how to use two free software programs to plot your data

The included Real Time Clock timestamps all your data with the current time, so that you know precisely what happened when!

SD card interface works with FAT16 or FAT32 formatted cards. 3.3v level shifter circuitry prevents damage to your SD card

Real time clock (RTC) keeps the time going even when the for arduino is unplugged. The battery backup lasts for years

Included libraries and example code for both SD and RTC mean you can get going quickly

Prototyping area for soldering connectors, circuitry or sensors.

Onboard 3.3v regulator is both a reliable reference voltage and also reliably runs SD cards that require a lot of power to run
